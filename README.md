# Teen Smartphone Classification

This project analyzes and models smartphone addiction levels among teenagers using survey data. The analysis is conducted in Python using popular data science libraries.

## Dataset

* [Teen Smartphone Usage and Addiction Impact Dataset (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sumedh1507/teen-phone-addiction)
* The dataset has been downloaded and is available in CSV format.

## Project Structure

* `notebook.ipynb` — The main notebook for EDA, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
* `requirements.txt` — Python dependency list.
* `model_phone_addiction/` — Trained model outputs.
* CSV data file (`teen_phone_addiction_dataset.csv`).

## Installation

1. Clone this repository
2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the notebook in Jupyter or VS Code

## Usage

1. Open and run all cells in `notebook.ipynb`
2. The analysis and modeling will execute automatically
3. Visualizations and model evaluation results can be viewed directly in the notebook

## Notes

* Ensure the dataset file (`teen_phone_addiction_dataset.csv`) is in the same directory as the notebook.
* The best-performing model can be saved and reused for future predictions.
